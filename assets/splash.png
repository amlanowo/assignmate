# This is a placeholder file
# The actual splash screen should be a PNG image
# For now, we'll use the icon as the splash screen
# 
# To create a proper splash screen:
# 1. Open your calendar icon in an image editor
# 2. Create a new canvas: 1242x2436 pixels (iPhone X resolution)
# 3. Set background to #000000 (black)
# 4. Place your icon in the center
# 5. Add "AssignMate" text below the icon
# 6. Save as PNG
# 
# For now, the app will use the icon as splash screen
